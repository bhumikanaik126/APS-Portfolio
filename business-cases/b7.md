##  Real-Time Click Stats & Impression Tracking using Fenwick Tree

### **üéØ The Challenge**

In high-traffic ad systems, every click and impression counts.

* **Millions of ads** generate **billions of clicks/impressions per day**
* Real-time updates are required to:

  * Track user engagement
  * Monitor budget consumption
  * Trigger billing
  * Optimize active campaigns

Traditional cumulative sum methods (like full array traversal) are **too slow** for real-time analytics.

### **üöÄ The Solution: Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree)**

A **Fenwick Tree**, or **Binary Indexed Tree (BIT)**, provides a way to:

* Efficiently **update** and **query** prefix sums in logarithmic time
* Maintain stats (clicks, impressions, conversions) **per ad, per user group, or per region**

It‚Äôs perfect for scenarios where **data is updated frequently**, and **cumulative stats** are needed instantly.

### **üß† Why Fenwick Tree?**

Fenwick Tree offers:

* **O(log n)** time for both `update()` and `prefix_sum()`
* Space-efficient: Requires just an auxiliary array
* Great for **time-series**, **rank-based metrics**, or **ID-mapped stats**

Used for:

* **Live CTR computation**: Clicks / Impressions
* **Segment-based aggregations**: Get total clicks for a range of ad IDs
* **Rolling window metrics**: Track activity per time block

---

### **üåê Conceptual Flow Example**

Suppose ad clicks are tracked in an array:

`[2, 0, 3, 7, 1, 5]`
(Each index represents an Ad ID; value is click count)

Using a Fenwick Tree, we can:

* `update(3, +2)` ‚Üí Add 2 more clicks to Ad ID 3
* `prefix_sum(4)` ‚Üí Get total clicks from ID 0 to 4

All in **O(log n)** time.

### **üí° Algorithmic Insight**

**Goal:** Support efficient prefix sum and update in O(log n) time.

**Core Idea:**
Each index in the tree stores the sum of a **range of elements**, determined by the **least significant bit (LSB)** in its binary representation.

#### **Update Operation (update index with +delta):**

1. Convert to 1-based index: `index++`
2. While `index <= size`:

   * Add `delta` to `tree[index]`
   * Move to next index using: `index += index & -index`

#### **Query Operation (prefix sum from 0 to index):**

1. Convert to 1-based index: `index++`
2. Initialize `sum = 0`
3. While `index > 0`:

   * Add `tree[index]` to sum
   * Move to previous index using: `index -= index & -index`

Only O(log n) nodes are visited due to binary breakdown of indices.
