## Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm ‚Äî Optimizing Ad Bandwidth Allocation in Google Ads

### üéØ The Challenge

Google Ads must efficiently allocate limited network bandwidth to deliver ads across millions of users and devices without delays or quality drops. The challenge is:

* Maximizing total ad data flow across a complex network of servers, CDNs, and user endpoints.
* Managing constrained bandwidth capacities on network links.
* Ensuring high-quality ad delivery while avoiding network congestion.

### üöÄ The Solution: Ford-Fulkerson Maximum Flow Algorithm

Ford-Fulkerson finds the maximum possible flow from a source to a sink in a network with capacity constraints.

Google can model the ad delivery network as a flow graph where:

* Nodes represent servers, caches, or end-user devices.
* Edges represent network links with bandwidth capacities.
* The algorithm maximizes total bandwidth flow from ad servers (source) to user devices (sink).

---

### üß† Why Ford-Fulkerson?

* Finds the maximum feasible ad bandwidth allocation given network constraints.
* Identifies bottleneck links limiting ad delivery.
* Helps optimize routing and scheduling for smooth ad streaming.
* Adaptable to dynamic network changes by re-running flow calculations.

Used for:

* Real-time bandwidth allocation for ad campaigns.
* Load balancing between CDN nodes.
* Optimizing multi-region ad delivery pipelines.

### üåê Conceptual Flow Example

* Source node: Google Ad server.
* Sink node: User device requesting ads.
* Edges: Network connections with limited bandwidth (capacity).
* Ford-Fulkerson iteratively finds augmenting paths to push more data until no more bandwidth can be allocated.

### üí° Algorithmic Insight

Goal: Maximize the flow of ad data from source to sink without exceeding any edge capacity.

Core Steps:

1. Initialize flow in all edges to zero.
2. While there exists an augmenting path from source to sink:

   * Find path with available capacity (residual capacity > 0).
   * Increase flow along the path by minimum residual capacity.
   * Update residual capacities.
3. When no augmenting path exists, maximum flow is reached.

### ‚è±Ô∏è Time and Space Complexity

| Operation               | Complexity                     |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Ford-Fulkerson max flow | O(E \* max\_flow) (worst case) |
| Space                   | O(V¬≤) (for adjacency matrix)   |

### üß™ Google Use Case

* Google Ads uses this to maximize throughput of video/audio ad streams.
* Optimizes bandwidth distribution between multiple regional CDN nodes.
* Ensures high-quality ad delivery during peak traffic without dropping connections.
* Identifies network bottlenecks to plan infrastructure upgrades.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Backend Enhancements

* Use Edmond-Karp variant for predictable runtime.
* Employ capacity scaling or push-relabel algorithms for large-scale graphs.
* Integrate with real-time network monitoring to dynamically adjust flows.
* Combine with machine learning models predicting traffic patterns.
