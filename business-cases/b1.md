# Relevance Ranking using Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)



### üéØ The Challenge

When a user enters a search query such as **"apple ios update"**, Google‚Äôs search engine needs to rank millions of documents by **relevance**. However, exact word matching often fails because:

* Query terms may appear in different orders.
* Documents may contain partial matches or gaps between relevant words.
* Semantic meaning depends on word order, not just presence.

Hence, the challenge is to find a scoring method that effectively measures **how well a document‚Äôs title or snippet matches the user‚Äôs query, even if the words are not contiguous but maintain order**.

---

### üöÄ The Solution: Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)

The **Longest Common Subsequence** algorithm finds the longest sequence of characters or words that appear **in the same order** in both the query and the document text, but not necessarily contiguously.

**LCS scoring** helps:

* Reward documents where query words appear in order (e.g., "apple update on ios" scores higher than "update apple ios").
* Tolerate gaps between words, unlike exact substring matches.
* Handle partial matches and reordered query terms gracefully.

---

### üß† Why LCS?

* **Preserves word order:** Captures semantic intent behind the query.
* **Allows partial matches:** Works even if some query terms are missing or separated.
* **Efficient dynamic programming implementation:** Suitable for real-time scoring across large datasets.
* **Versatile:** Can be applied to document titles, snippets, or even body text.

---

### üåê Conceptual Flow Example

For a query **Q = "apple ios update"** and a document title **D = "latest ios update from apple"**:

* The LCS could be `"apple ios update"` or `"ios update apple"`.
* The length and content of the LCS determine the similarity score.
* Documents with longer LCS scores get ranked higher.

### üí° Algorithmic Insight

Goal: Compute LCS length between query and document strings.

Core Steps:

* Initialize a 2D DP table `dp` of size `(m+1) x (n+1)` where `m` and `n` are lengths of query and document respectively.
* For each character/word pair:

  * If they match, `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1`
  * Else, `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])`
* Final LCS length is `dp[m][n]`.
* Normalize or combine with other features for final ranking.

### ‚è±Ô∏è Time and Space Complexity

| Operation        | Complexity |
| ---------------- | ---------- |
| LCS Computation  | O(m \* n)  |
| Space Complexity | O(m \* n)  |

*where `m` and `n` are lengths of query and document respectively*

### üß™ Google Use Case

* **Google Search:** Rank documents by matching query words with titles and snippets using LCS scores.
* **Google Discover:** Personalize feed cards based on LCS similarity between user interests and article headlines.
* **Google Play Store:** Match app names and descriptions with search keywords using LCS to boost relevant apps.
* **YouTube Search:** Improve video title matching to user queries when exact matches don‚Äôt exist.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Backend Enhancements

* Combine LCS score with other ranking features like TF-IDF, semantic embeddings.
* Use approximate LCS or optimized variants for large-scale ranking.
* Cache frequent LCS computations for popular queries.
* Integrate with machine learning models for final relevance prediction.
