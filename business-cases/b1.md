## Relevance Ranking using Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)

üîç *Matching user query with document titles or content using dynamic programming*

---

### ‚úÖ Problem Statement

When a user searches for something like **"apple ios update"**, the search engine must determine which documents are **most relevant**, even if the words appear in a **different order or partially**.

We need a scoring method that rewards documents with **similar word sequences** ‚Äî even if not exact.

---

### üß† Why LCS?

- **LCS (Longest Common Subsequence)** finds the longest sequence that appears **in order** in both strings, but not necessarily **contiguously**.
- Ideal for:
  - Query vs. Document Title
  - Query vs. Snippet
- It allows partial matches, while still **preserving the order** of the original query, which is crucial for semantic meaning.

### üß™ Real Google Use Case

For every indexed document:

- Extract its **title** and/or **snippet**
- Calculate **LCS score** with the user query
- Use this as a **feature** in the ranking algorithm
