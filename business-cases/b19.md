## üéØ The Challenge

Google‚Äôs services like Maps, Ads, Play, and Discover rely heavily on **finding the most efficient paths** within large and dynamic graphs:

* **Google Maps**: Find the shortest and fastest routes for navigation with real-time traffic.
* **Google Ads**: Optimize paths for user conversion funnels, minimizing cost per acquisition.
* **Google Play**: Streamline user navigation paths to desired apps.
* **Google Discover**: Recommend content via minimal friction paths to increase engagement.

Computing these paths quickly and accurately is critical, and **Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm** offers a powerful solution.

## üí° Algorithmic Insight

### Goal:

Use **Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm** to find minimum-cost paths from source nodes (user location, entry page, content node) to all other nodes.

### Core Steps:

1. Initialize distances from source to all nodes as ‚àû except source (0).
2. Use a min-priority queue to repeatedly select the node with the smallest distance.
3. Relax edges: update distances of neighbors if a shorter path is found.
4. Repeat until all nodes are processed.
