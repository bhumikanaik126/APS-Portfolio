# Types of Data Distributions & Their Use Cases at Google

Understanding different types of data distributions helps Google analyze patterns, detect anomalies, and improve services like Ads, Maps, Play Store, and Discover.

---

## 1. Uniform Distribution: Equal Probability in Google Systems

### What It Is

All outcomes within a range have an equal chance of occurring.

### Google Relevance

* Randomly distributing **ad impressions evenly** across users to avoid bias.
* Initializing parameters in machine learning models **with uniform randomness** for fair starts.

### Example

Assigning equal probability to serving an ad to any user in a target group.

## 2. Normal Distribution: Modeling User Behavior Patterns

### What It Is

Data clusters symmetrically around an average value with natural variation.

### Google Relevance

* Modeling metrics like **average session durations** or **page load times**.
* Detecting anomalies when user behavior deviates significantly from the norm.

### Example

Understanding typical user engagement time on Google Discover feeds.

## 3. Poisson Distribution: Counting Rare Events in Google Services

### What It Is

Probability of a given number of events happening in a fixed time or space, with independent events.

### Google Relevance

* Estimating the number of **ad clicks per minute** or **API calls per second**.
* Detecting sudden spikes of suspicious activity like **review spam bursts** in Google Maps or Play Store.

### Example

Monitoring the count of new user reviews within an hour to flag potential bots.

## 4. Binomial Distribution: Success Rates in Google Experiments

### What It Is

Modeling the number of successes out of fixed independent trials, each with the same success chance.

### Google Relevance

* Evaluating **click-through rates** on ads shown to users.
* Analyzing results of **A/B testing** experiments on Google platforms to improve UI/UX.

### Example

Tracking how many users click a specific feature in Google Play after a rollout.
