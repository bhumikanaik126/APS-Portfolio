## **Mo’s Algorithm — Fast Range-Based Review Anomaly Detection**



### **🎯 The Challenge**

Google Maps and Play Store must handle:

* Huge volume of review data per region/app
* Need for real-time anomaly detection (spikes, repetition)
* Identifying users or regions with statistical outliers

Example:
"Has user X written 20 5-star reviews within 10 minutes, all for random, unrelated businesses?"

We need a system to query suspicious activity efficiently across large datasets.

### **🚀 The Solution: Mo’s Algorithm**

Mo’s Algorithm is a technique to optimize multiple range queries on a static array. It minimizes rework by processing queries in a block-wise, sorted order.

---

### **🧠 Why Mo’s Algorithm?**

It provides:

* Fast batch processing of range queries (O((N + Q)√N))
* Works well when review data is stored as time-sorted logs
* Can detect abnormal density or repetition in a time window

Applications in Google:

* Detecting flood of fake reviews
* Tracking repeated reviewers over a time range
* Spotting rating patterns within a date range

---

### **🌐 Conceptual Flow Example**

You have a list of reviews per minute:

```
[5, 4, 5, 1, 5, 2, 5, 3, 5, 5]
```

You want to run multiple queries like:

* Count how many times 5-star reviews appear between time L and R

Instead of re-counting for each query, Mo’s algorithm maintains a rolling frequency.

### **💡 Algorithmic Insight**

1. Divide the array into √N blocks
2. Sort queries by:

   * Block number of L
   * Then by R
3. Move L and R pointers smartly:

   * Add/remove elements and update frequency counters

### **⏱️ Time and Space Complexity**

| Operation               | Complexity             |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Preprocessing           | O(Q log Q)             |
| Query processing (Mo's) | O((N + Q)√N)           |
| Space (frequency map)   | O(K), K = rating scale |

---

### **🌍Google Use Case**

Used to:

* Detect unusual spikes of similar ratings across time
* Analyze time-local patterns in reviews
* Spot anomalies in batch behavior by accounts

Example:
Flood of 5-star ratings on a random app or business within a few minutes — may indicate manipulation.
