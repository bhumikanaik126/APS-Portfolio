##  Bitmask Dynamic Programming (DP) for Google Search and Ads Personalization


### 🎯 **Problem**

Google handles **millions of user interests** and **constraints**:

* Recommend a **subset of items** (videos, products, ads, or apps) satisfying **specific rules**
* Users may **prefer** or **block** certain topics, categories, or sources
* Optimize for **maximum value (CTR, relevance, engagement)** under such constraints

This problem often boils down to:

> “Find the best combination of items satisfying multiple conditions.”

### 🧠 **Core Idea: Use Bitmasking + DP**

Bitmask DP is useful when:

* We need to **try all subsets efficiently**
* We have up to **20–25 categories or states**
* Each state can be represented as a **bit in a binary number**

### 📈 **Google Use Cases for Bitmask DP**

| Use Case                  | Bitmask DP Role                                                                |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Personalized Ad Selection | Choose best combination of ads matching user preferences                       |
| Discover Feed Curation    | Select articles from diverse categories while avoiding repetition              |
| Play Store App Bundling   | Offer app combos (e.g., "productivity pack") covering all user-needs minimally |
| Google Survey Targeting   | Choose participants covering all demographic filters efficiently               |

### 🔢 **Example Problem**

> You want to suggest **apps** from different **categories** such that:
>
> 1. You **cover all needed categories**
> 2. You **minimize total app count** or **maximize rating score**

Each category is a bit. Apps cover multiple categories.

### 📊 Time & Space Complexity

| Aspect | Complexity                       |
| ------ | -------------------------------- |
| Time   | O(N \* 2^K) where K = categories |
| Space  | O(2^K)                           |

### 🧠 Real-World Google Mapping

Bitmask DP helps Google:

* Run **multi-category optimizations** under strict budget/engagement constraints
* Avoid combinatorial explosion in **subset-based decisions**
* Filter feeds/ads/apps based on **multi-criteria rules** dynamically

---

### ⚙️ Enhancements

* Add **score maximization** instead of app count
* Add **conflict masks** (avoid overlapping categories)
* Use **memoization + recursion** for clarity

---


### ✅ Key Takeaways

* Bitmask DP is a **powerful tool for subset problems** involving combinations of features
* Google uses similar strategies for **personalization, ad selection, and filtering**
* Ideal when **categories/features are limited (\~20–25)**
