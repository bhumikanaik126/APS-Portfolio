## 📈 PageRank — Ranking Web Pages via Link Graph Analysis


### 🎯 The Challenge

Google Search needs to rank billions of web pages by their **importance and relevance** to deliver the best search results.

The challenge:

* How to determine which pages are **more authoritative**?
* How to use the massive web’s **link structure** effectively?
* How to compute these rankings efficiently on a gigantic scale?

---

### 🚀 The Solution: PageRank Algorithm (Random Walk on Link Graph)

PageRank models the web as a **directed graph** where:

* Nodes = Web pages
* Edges = Hyperlinks from one page to another

PageRank assigns a **score** to each page based on the quantity and quality of inbound links.

---

### 🧠 Why PageRank?

* Pages linked by many important pages are considered important themselves
* Reflects the **“vote of confidence”** from other pages
* Enables Google to rank search results by **authority and trustworthiness**
* Works globally, considering entire web link structure, not just keywords

---

### 🌐 Conceptual Flow Example

* Page A links to Page B and C
* Page B links to Page C
* Page C links back to A
* Page C has many incoming links — it gets a higher rank
* Random web surfer model: Probability that a user lands on a page after clicking links

---

### 💡 Algorithmic Insight

PageRank is computed iteratively:

* Initialize scores equally
* At each iteration, update page score as a **weighted sum** of scores from pages linking to it
* Damping factor models the probability of random jumps to any page
* Repeat until scores converge

### ⏱️ Time and Space Complexity

| Operation            | Complexity                               |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Each iteration       | O(V + E)                                 |
| Number of iterations | Depends on convergence (typically < 100) |
| Space                | O(V)                                     |

### 🌐 Google Use Case

* PageRank was the **core algorithm** powering Google Search’s initial success
* Helps rank search results by authority and relevance beyond keyword matching
* Continues to influence modern ranking algorithms combined with machine learning
* Supports **spam detection** by demoting low-authority pages

---

### ⚙️ Backend Enhancements

* Use **personalized PageRank** for user-specific ranking
* Combine with **topic-sensitive PageRank** to focus rankings on user interests
* Scale with **distributed graph processing frameworks** like MapReduce and Pregel
