## Personalized Content Feed using DFS in Google's Ecosystem


### 🎯 **Problem**

Google needs to personalize content recommendations based on **user interests** and **semantic proximity** in a large content graph:

* Which articles/videos/posts/reviews are closely related to a user’s interest?
* How to **explore connected topics** like “machine learning → deep learning → transformers”?
* How to **avoid cycles** or redundant suggestions?

---

### 🧠 **Core Idea: Use Depth-First Search (DFS)**

* Model topics as a **graph**, where nodes = content entities (articles, videos, reviews)
* Edges represent **semantic or interaction links** (e.g., "viewed-together", "linked topics", "replied to", "commented on", etc.)
* DFS explores **deep, connected content** for in-depth personalized recommendations.

### 🗺️ **How DFS Helps Google**

| Use Case in Google  | DFS Role                                                                                    |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Google Discover     | Explore connected news articles from a core interest (e.g., politics → policies → speeches) |
| Google News Feed    | Traverse topic clusters deeply for related coverage                                         |
| YouTube Explore     | Find videos connected through interactions and content tags                                 |
| Google Maps Reviews | Show reviews that are contextually linked across users/places                               |

### 🔄 Example Output

```
Personalized content from: ML
ML
--Deep Learning
----CNNs
------ImageNet
----RNNs
--NLP
----Transformers
----BERT
```

This simulates how Google can dive into **depth-related content**, not just breadth (like BFS).

### 📊 Time & Space Complexity

| Aspect | DFS                  |
| ------ | -------------------- |
| Time   | O(V + E)             |
| Space  | O(V) for visited set |

---

### 🔍 Why Google Uses DFS

* **In-depth exploration**: Not just what's trending, but what’s **semantically deep**
* DFS-style crawl gives richer, **layered content suggestions**
* Can be personalized: limit depth based on user patience level or interest profile

---

### 🧠 Enhancements

* Add weights for relevance (weighted DFS / limit depth by score)
* Combine DFS with **click signals** and **feedback loops**
* Use in **hybrid models** (DFS for depth, BFS for freshness)
