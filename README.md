## 🔰 **1. Introduction**

### 🧭 1.1 Why Google?

> **"Solving at scale. Optimizing for billions. Innovating every millisecond."**

Google, as a technology leader, builds products that touch **billions of users**—from **search** to **ads**, **videos**, **maps**, and more. At the heart of these products lies a deep reliance on **data structures**, **algorithms**, and **system design**. These are not just theoretical concepts, but live tools that power:

* Instant search result rankings,  
* Personalized content recommendations,  
* Efficient route planning,  
* Ad relevance matching,  
* Spam detection, and more.

Choosing **Google** as the domain for this portfolio allows me to explore **real-world business cases** where problem-solving at scale is essential. It offers a diverse and challenging landscape to apply:

* **Dynamic Programming**,  
* **Graph Algorithms**,  
* **Search Techniques**,  
* **Combinatorics and Number Theory**,  
* And **Advanced Data Structures** (like Segment Trees, Tries, Fenwick Trees, and Persistent Trees).

> “This portfolio is my attempt to walk in the footsteps of Google’s engineering mindset—where theory meets action, and efficiency meets experience.”

### 🎯 1.2 Goals of This Portfolio

This portfolio aims to:

* ✅ **Bridge theory and practice** by implementing well-known algorithms to solve real-world problems inspired by Google.  
* ✅ **Model business cases** around search, ads, recommendations, email management, routing, and user analytics.  
* ✅ **Apply a wide range of algorithms** (from recursion to greedy, DP to graph traversal, segment trees to MO’s algorithm).  
* ✅ **Analyze time/space trade-offs**, use appropriate data structures, and optimize for edge cases.  
* ✅ **Design systems** that are modular, scalable, and reflective of how Google builds software.  
* ✅ **Visualize problems** with diagrams, flowcharts, and interactive tools.  
* ✅ **Experiment** with algorithms across data sizes to simulate large-scale systems (Google-scale).

### 🔗 Connection to APS Course

This portfolio is not built from scratch. It stands on the rich base of:

* Concepts from **Dynamic Programming** (Knapsack, LCS, Subset Sum, Coin Combinations)  
* **Search strategies** (BFS, DFS, A\*, Heuristics)  
* **Combinatorics and Number Theory** (Catalan Numbers, Fermat’s Theorem, MMI)  
* **Range Query Algorithms** (Segment Trees, Fenwick Tree, MO’s Algorithm)  
* **Stable Marriage**, **Johnson-Trotter**, and **Borůvka’s Algorithm**  
* System design thinking from projects like the **pincode application**

Thus, this project synthesizes the APS course content into a cohesive set of practical solutions inspired by Google’s real-time challenges.

Would you like me to move on to structuring the **first business case (Search Ranking System)** or would you prefer a visual diagram showing how all cases are connected to Google products first?
