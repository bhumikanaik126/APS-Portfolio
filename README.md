## 🌱 Introduction – Domain Intro

Google’s large-scale systems solve billions of queries daily. This section introduces the domain and why algorithms are foundational to Google’s infrastructure and user experience.

## 🎯 Objectives – Goals and Targets

- Understand the link between business needs and algorithms  
- Analyze how DSA powers search, personalization, and routing  
- Evaluate the efficiency of algorithmic choices used in real systems

## 📈 Business Use Cases ➡️ Algorithmic Solutions

| Service        | Problem Solved                    | Algorithm Used              |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Google Search  | Ranking web pages                 | PageRank, Greedy, Graph     |
| YouTube        | Personalized recommendations      | Clustering, Filtering       |
| Google Maps    | Real-time navigation              | Dijkstra, A*, Heuristics    |
| Google Ads     | Bid optimization                  | Greedy, Dynamic Programming |

## 📊 Use Case Insights and Efficiency Metrics

- Measured in terms of **latency**, **accuracy**, and **scalability**
- Example: A* in Maps optimizes for real-time traffic with minimal delay  
- Time-space trade-offs in large graph processing (e.g., for route planning)

## 🧠 Key Learnings and Insights

- How algorithms support business goals  
- Designing for real-time user responsiveness  
- Key DSA lessons in abstraction, performance tuning, and decision-making
